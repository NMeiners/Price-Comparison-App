# Price Comparison App

A single-page web application that allows users to find products and compare prices at nearby stores using only client-side technologies. This project is built entirely by OpenAI's ChatGPT using developer input and feedback. The application runs entirely in the browser, requiring no backend server. This app was built for a class project. This README was generated by ChatGPT and manually reviewed for accuracy.

## Project Overview

**Price Comparison App** helps users locate products like groceries, electronics, or other items in nearby stores. The app combines geolocation, map visualization, and multiple search strategies to provide local product references and best-effort price dataâ€”all client-side.

The app uses:

- **Leaflet** for interactive map rendering.

- **Overpass API** for primary local store search.

- **Nominatim API** as a fallback for additional place results.

- **Client-side shopping snippet parsing** for price lookup attempts.

## Features and Functionality

- Geolocation-aware search: Detects user location to show nearby stores.  

- Interactive map: Pins indicate store locations with popups showing details.  

- Product search with variants: Attempts to expand item searches like "milk" into related variants (e.g., "2% milk," "skim milk"). Still in development. 

- Distance and unit selection: Display distances in kilometers or miles.  

- Theme support: Light and dark modes.  

- Search radius adjustment: Easily filter nearby stores by radius.  

- Price parsing: Attempts to extract prices from shopping snippets or store websites.  

- Fallback links: If structured results fail, users can open external search links.  

- Client-only architecture: Runs fully in the browser, no backend required.

## Known Issues and Limitations

- Search relevance: Some searches may return irrelevant results or miss nearby stores due to fuzzy matching limitations.  

- Price extraction: Parsing prices from shopping snippets or store websites is best-effort and may fail depending on CORS restrictions or site structure.  

- Code maintainability: The JavaScript is currently a single file and could benefit from modularization, cleaning, and inline comments.  

- UI edge cases: Very broad searches or large result sets may clutter the map or panels.  

- Geolocation dependency: The app requires location access to provide accurate nearby results.  

- Project naming: The AI-generated code originally referred to the app as "Local Price Finder," which may appear in some parts of the interface.

## Future Enhancements

- Improved search algorithm: Enhance fuzzy matching and tokenization for more accurate results.  
- Modular code structure: Split JavaScript into modules for easier maintenance and readability.

- Code readability: Add descriptive comments for easier code review and debugging.   

- Better UI/UX: Add features like pagination for results, clustering map markers, and inline price previews.  

- Accessibility improvements: Add ARIA labels and improve keyboard navigation.

## How to Run

The app is deployed and can be accessed via GitHub Pages at:

[**Price Comparison App Live Demo**]([https://yourusername.github.io/price-comparison-app/](https://nmeiners.github.io/Price-Comparison-App/))

To use the app:

1. Open the above link in a modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).  
2. Allow location access to see nearby stores.  
3. Enter an item in the search bar and adjust the search radius as needed.

**Note:** This app is fully client-side. All data processing occurs in the browser, and no user data is sent to any server.
