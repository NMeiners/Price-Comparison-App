ChatGPT prompts:
- I want you to create a single page web app that gets the user's location and searches nearby stores for specific items so that the user can compare prices. This will be deployed using github pages and will have no additional resources, so it will need to work purely from the browser. Keep asking me clarifying questions until you have enough information to create the web app.
- No data source will be provided. The web app will have to perform its own searches while using the user's location to narrow results and should include any results it manages to find. It will need the user's location, so it should ask. The app should be able to handle a variety of searches. The user should be able to have different sorting formats. I will leave UI decisions and deployment choices up to you as long as it works entirely from github using github pages. Is there anything else you need to know?
- For the first one, let's focus on the no keys option as I don't have any API keys I can provide you. If you can access a public API, great. For the second one, let's focus on just using text searches for now. For sorting, do what makes sense based on the purpose of the app and the information that can be acquired.
- If you can get the app to display results as close to how it would appear in the source site, let's go with that. It should be able to support both desktop and mobile layouts, but let's focus on getting it to work before we worry about expanding functionality.
- Let's focus on getting it working properly and improving the UI for now. Currently it does not come up with any results. The user may input non-specific searches, so it will need a way to find related items. For example, the user might search for "milk" and the app will need to return results for 2% and whole milk. Also, meters is not a very user-friendly measurement. Let's have it use kilometers or miles. If you can improve the appearance to make it easier to view, please do so.
- The goal of the app is to shop via local physical stores, so online shopping is out of scope for now. If you can implement google shopping and bing shopping search parsing to improve search results, please do so. Do what you feel works best to improve search results.
- Do what you feel works best given the purpose of the app. If you can find a way to get the best of both worlds, even better.
